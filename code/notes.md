1. Check the bounds of array
2. Check the size of internal DS required ex: float, integer
3. Check if +ve, -ve, 0 numbers accepted
4. Handle all corner cases: empty, null, duplicate cases
5. Never copy lines. Always write. Ex: copy loop of i in j
6. Make sure all test cases are covered for a question. Infact before starting the solution try to cover all test cases 
   before hand. Ex: for sliding window questions, the patterns should be alternate, match in star and nothing towards 
   end, vice versa, match in the middle only.
